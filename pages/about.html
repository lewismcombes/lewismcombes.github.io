<h1>About me</h1>

<p>
  My name is Lewis Combes (pronounced as though it has two "o"s, though it does not). I studied for my PhD at the University of Sheffield under the supervision of <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/mhaluksengun/"> Haluk Şengün</a> from October 2019 to April 2024. 
</p>

<p>
  My primary research interests are in number theory, specifically automorphic forms, Selmer groups, and other objects of arithmetic significance. I particularly enjoy computational work.
